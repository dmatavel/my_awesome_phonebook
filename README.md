# my_awesome_phonebook

## **Description:**

My Awesome PhoneBook is an introductory exercise in the C++ language. Its aim is to learn namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and a few other basic things.

## **Instructions:**

**Compiling the source files:**
- Enter the program directory and insert `make`.

**Run the program:**
- Insert `./phonebook`.

Once the program is run, the user must enter one of three options: ADD, SEARCH or EXIT (uppercase is not mandatory):

- ADD: Add a new contact. A maximum of 8 contacts can be added; if a ninth contact is added, the oldest is replaced by the most recent.

- SEARCH: Displays a list with basic information about saved contacts. You can display more information about a specific contact by entering its index.

- EXIT: Quit the program. All saved contacts are lost forever!
